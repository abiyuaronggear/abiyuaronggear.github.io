#### The Apostles’ Creed
I believe in God,<br>
the Father almighty,<br>
Creator of heaven and earth,<br>
and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,<br>
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,<br>
born of the Virgin Mary,<br>
suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br>
was crucified, died and was buried;<br>
he descended into hell;<br>
on the third day he rose again from the dead;<br>
he ascended into heaven,<br>
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;<br>
from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.<br>
I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br>
the holy catholic Church,<br>
the communion of saints,<br>
the forgiveness of sins,<br>
the resurrection of the body,<br>
and life everlasting.<br>
Amen.


#### Our Father
Our Father who art in heaven,<br>
hallowed be thy name.<br>
Thy kingdom come.<br>
Thy will be done<br>
on earth, as it is in heaven.<br>
Give us this day<br>
our daily bread,<br>
and forgive us our trespasses,<br>
as we forgive those who trespass against us,<br>
and lead us not into temptation,<br>
but deliver us from evil. Amen.


#### The Hail Mary
Hail, Mary, full of grace,<br>
the Lord is with thee.<br>
Blessed art thou among women<br>
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.<br>
Holy Mary, Mother of God,<br>
pray for us sinners,<br>
now and at the hour of our death.<br>
Amen.


#### Glory Be
Glory be to the Father<br>
and to the Son<br>
and to the Holy Spirit,<br>
as it was in the beginning<br>
is now, and ever shall be<br>
world without end. Amen.


#### The Fátima Prayer
O My Jesus,<br>
forgive us our sins,<br>
save us from the fires of hell.<br>
Lead all souls to Heaven,<br>
especially those most in need of Thy mercy.


####  Hail Holy Queen
Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy,<br>
our life, our sweetness and our hope.<br>
To thee do we cry,<br>
poor banished children of Eve.<br>
To thee do we send up our sighs,<br>
mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.<br>
Turn then, most gracious advocate,<br>
thine eyes of mercy toward us,<br>
and after this our exile<br>
show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.<br>
O clement, O loving,<br>
O sweet Virgin Mary.

**V.** _Pray for us, O holy Mother of God._<br>
**R.** That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

_Let us pray_.

O God, whose only-begotten Son,<br>
by his life, death and resurrection,<br>
has purchased for us<br>
the rewards of eternal life,<br>
grant, we beseech thee,<br>
that while meditating on these mysteries<br>
of the most holy Rosary of the<br>
Blessed Virgin Mary,<br>
we may imitate what they contain<br>
and obtain what they promise,<br>
through the same Christ our Lord.<br>
Amen.
